# NHANES Children's Health Analysis
This Project can also be viewed on my Tableau Public profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adam.meyer8878/viz/DataVisPart2/Story1)

Understanding the relationship between children’s health and family income is important for identifying health issues. By analyzing this data, we can find patterns or trends in children’s health, such as illnesses, obesity, and other chronic conditions. These results can help identify which issues need to be addressed first so that there can be prevention and treatment strategies. Additionally, this data can help create public policies by informing the public. And this information can help policymakers make informed decisions about how to allocate resources to address these issues. 

When looking at the family income with the health data, we can identify if any of the issues are related to the resources that these children are given. Wealthier children tend to have more access to health care and more nutritional food, so using this data can help identify if this does in fact lead to better health status. Then, upon further investigation, we can gain insights into what other factors contribute to these disparities so that we can improve our strategies to create equal opportunities for children to obtain better health.

## Target Questions
How does children’s health compare between different household incomes?

Does their income level affect their access to healthcare?
